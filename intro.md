# cryptoc (*working title*)

Cryptography, or the art of writing secrets through secret writings, seems to have appeared only a few centuries after writing itself. Secrecy, as a tool, is a natural part of the human trades. Then, one century after an other, cryptography evolved and from it stemmed various sciences in the modern era :
* cryptography itself as the practice of *secret code*
* cryptanalysis as the practice of bypassing cryptography
* cryptology as the theorized science behind both -graphy and -analysis)
* cryptosystem engineering to cite just one more

As a thumb rule, based on the various best-sellers on the subject and student courses, cryptography is studied along two, usually mutually exclusive, lines
* cryptography as a science, mostly regarding the internals (a.k.a. *maths*, and information theory too, let's not forget it)
* cryptography as a tool, usually in engineering context (mostly, communications and information systems)

Both of this paths are more than legit, and, when well done, admirable and enjoyable (although as most things in life, joy may not be perceived or shared by anyone, alas). There is neverless an other path that may be worth walking and that may, if properly done, lead to opening new a new door into cryptography. A door as in a new access to it, an access as in a bridge into cryptography for a slightly (but usually overlapping) public. A path where the objective is neither to have the mastery of a cryptographer nor the tooling for engineery, but to simply satisfy the curiosity of some of the autodidacts amongst us that may find through it way more than a door into cryptography, but into new ideas and problematics larger than what a simple book could cover.

This book is a shot at opening this door. This book is an expedition along this path, trying to turn personal experience of autodidact cryptography discovery into a shareable and enjoyable knowledge. This book is about one thing : neither about maths, neither about code, nor about engineering ; just about savoring the exquisite art of cryptography (with a bit of cryptanalysis concern, as both are interlinked, but, with all due respect, not sciency enough for cryptology eligibility).


## The truth behind the spoon

Before anything and going straight into the subject first-hand, gently I promise, one first bit of information :
> everything is information

Everything else is just a question of formatting, presenting, interpreting. Whether in a binary form, using numbers, letters, sigils, whatever : it is information and, lucky for us, information is at the heart of the subject.

### Mathematical first pit stop

Each of this format, cast into symbols, form a whole universe of sort, from which it is possible to jump into an other one according to the rules of translation between. The usual example is on one hand the extended ASCII and on the other one a ring going from 0 to 255. Thanks to the bijectivity between both, the bridge between the human universe and the machine universe has been built.

### tl;dr
* information
* presenting
* universe


## The essence of cryptography

The basic goal is to take an original information (let's name it *cleartext*) and to turn into a different information (let's name it *cyphertext*). There are multiple uses, although mostly around storing and sharing, but the main trick is about the notion of secrecy, the limitation of access to the original information to unwanted individuals.

From there, the whole path is a charming bucolic walk, observing the internal machinery invented and reinvented through the ages in order to further this secrecy goal.

### tl;dr
* cleartext
* cyphertext


From this point, each chapter will cover an algorithm
